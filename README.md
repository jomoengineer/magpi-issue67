Repository for code featured in The MagPi 67

This version changes the dependancy on bcm_host.h and DISPMANX to use the X11 features to support the Raspberry Pi 4. 

Need to change the Build Options from Linker settings and Search Directories to point to the /usr/arm/arm-linux-gnueabihf lib and include folders.
